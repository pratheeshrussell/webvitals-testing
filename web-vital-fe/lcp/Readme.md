## LCP Score
As of Light house version 9, LCP accounts for 25% of the overall score. A score less than 1.2s is considered good and score greater than 2.4s is bad.


**Note** LCP, unlike FCP, considers the largest text/image block in the *viewport* and not the page. So better dock dev tools to side or undock it to a separate window.
