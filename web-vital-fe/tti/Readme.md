## TTI Score
As of Light house version 9, TTI accounts for 10% of the overall score. A score less than 3.8s is considered good.

## Demo

2. tti-split.html  
Note that there are tasks even after TTI but since they are smaller tasks(less than 50ms) it is not considered for TTI.

3. tti-cheat.html  
This is not supposed to be a method to improve TTI. Just demonstrating that TTI is not affected by longer tasks after that initial gap of 5 seconds.
